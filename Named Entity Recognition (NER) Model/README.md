# Named Entity Recognition (NER) Model

## Overview

This repository contains a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model built for identifying and classifying entities in text. NER is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities (persons, organizations, locations, etc.) in unstructured text.

## Model Architecture

The NER model is built using [choose your framework/library, e.g., SpaCy, NLTK, TensorFlow, PyTorch]. It leverages a [choose the underlying model architecture, e.g., Bidirectional LSTM-CRF] for sequence labeling.

## Dataset

The model was trained on a dataset containing annotated examples of text with labeled entities. The dataset used for training can be found in [provide a link or reference to the dataset].
